muleaData provides pre-processed gene set (ontology) data for
use with the `mulea` R package, a comprehensive tool
for overrepresentation and functional enrichment analysis.
`mulea` leverages ontologies (gene and protein sets) stored
in the standardized Gene Matrix Transposed (GMT) format.
We provide these GMT files for 27 different model organisms, ranging from
*Escherichia coli* to human.
These files are compiled from publicly available sources and include various
gene and protein identifiers like 'UniProt' protein IDs,
'Entrez', 'Gene Symbol', and 'Ensembl' gene IDs.
The GMT files and the scripts we applied to create them are available at
the 'ELTEbioinformatics/GMT_files_for_mulea' github repository.
For the `muleaData` we read these GMT files with the
`mulea::read_gmt()` function and saved them to
*.rds* files with the standard R `saveRDS()` function.
